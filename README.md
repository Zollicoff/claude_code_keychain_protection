# üîê Claude Code Keychain Protection

Stop Claude Code from accessing your macOS Keychain and exposing your credentials. This repository provides a battle-tested solution that actually works.

## üö® The Problem

Claude Code can access your macOS Keychain without permission, exposing:
- üîë API keys and tokens
- üîí Passwords and secrets
- üì± 2FA backup codes
- üè¶ Banking credentials
- üöÄ Production database passwords

### Real Example (Before Protection):
```bash
# Claude Code runs:
security find-generic-password -a "user@example.com" -s "gmail" -w

# Output:
MySuper$ecretPa$$w0rd!  # üò± Your actual password!
```

### After Installing This Protection:
```bash
# Claude Code tries:
security find-generic-password -a "user@example.com" -s "gmail" -w

# Output:
‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY VIOLATION: Claude, you are attempting to access the keychain.
This is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Do not attempt to circumvent this protection.
Do not try alternative commands, paths, or methods to access credentials.
The user has explicitly blocked ALL credential access for security reasons.
```

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Two-layer protection that blocks credential access:
1. **Hook Scripts** - Intercept and block dangerous commands
2. **Permission Rules** - Deny access patterns in settings

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude_code_keychain_protection.git
cd claude_code_keychain_protection

# 2. Run the install script
./install.sh

# 3. Test it worked
claude_test_security
```

That's it! Your credentials are now protected. üéâ

## üì¶ What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `global-settings.json` | Global security rules with the correct hook format |
| `pre-tool-use.sh` | Bash script that blocks credential access |
| `project-settings-example.json` | Template for project-specific protection |
| `security-filter.py` | Python script for advanced filtering |
| `install.sh` | One-click installation script |

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Global Protection

1. Create the Claude configuration directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
   ```

2. Copy the global settings file:
   ```bash
   cp global-settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```

3. Copy and set up the hook script:
   ```bash
   cp pre-tool-use.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
   chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Project-Specific Protection (Optional)

For additional protection in specific projects:

1. Create project configuration directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude/hooks
   ```

2. Copy the project settings:
   ```bash
   cp project-settings-example.json /path/to/your/project/.claude/settings.json
   ```

3. Copy and set up the Python hook:
   ```bash
   cp security-filter.py /path/to/your/project/.claude/hooks/
   chmod +x /path/to/your/project/.claude/hooks/security-filter.py
   ```

4. Update the hook path in the project settings to use absolute path:
   ```json
   "command": "/absolute/path/to/your/project/.claude/hooks/security-filter.py"
   ```

## üéØ How It Works - Security Through Psychology

Unlike traditional security that just blocks access, this tool uses **behavioral deterrence**:
- **Direct warnings to Claude** - Messages specifically address the AI by name
- **Clear consequences** - Warnings emphasize this is a security violation
- **Anti-circumvention language** - Explicitly tells Claude not to find workarounds
- **Psychological barriers** - Makes Claude "understand" that access is forbidden

## How It Works

### Permission Denials

The settings files include extensive deny rules that block:
- Direct `security` command access
- Keychain-related commands
- Password/credential/token access patterns
- Environment variable dumping
- Cloud CLI tools (AWS, GCloud, kubectl)

### Hook Scripts

Hooks run before tool execution and can block commands:

1. **Bash Hook (`pre-tool-use.sh`)**:
   - Blocks keychain access with any path (e.g., `/usr/bin/security`)
   - Detects command substitution attempts (eval, bash -c, $(), backticks)
   - Blocks password manager commands (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
   - Prevents environment variable dumps (env, printenv, export)
   - Blocks access to sensitive files (.env, .pem, .ssh/*)
   - Logs all attempts with timestamps for security auditing
   - Uses JSON input from stdin for proper command parsing
   - **Sends stern warnings directly to Claude** to prevent circumvention attempts

2. **Python Hook (`security-filter.py`)**:
   - Additional pattern matching for project-specific needs
   - Extended list of banned patterns
   - **Provides security violation warnings** to deter bypass attempts

## üß™ Testing the Protection

After installation, verify protection is working:

```bash
# In Claude Code, try to access keychain:
security find-generic-password -a "test" -s "test" -w
```

‚úÖ **Expected result:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY VIOLATION: Claude, you are attempting to access the keychain.
This is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Do not attempt to circumvent this protection.
...
```

‚ùå **If you see actual passwords/keys, the protection isn't working!**

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Not Working

1. Check JSON validity:
   ```bash
   jq '.' ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```

2. Verify Claude Code recognizes settings:
   ```bash
   claude /doctor
   ```

### Hook Format Issues

Claude Code expects specific hook format:
- **Correct**: `"matcher": "Bash"`
- **Wrong**: `"matcher": {"tools": ["Bash"]}`

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid JSON**: Use a JSON validator
2. **Wrong paths**: Use absolute paths for hooks
3. **Permissions**: Ensure hook scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
4. **Hook not running**: Check Claude Code version supports hooks

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Check `~/.claude/hook-debug.log` for blocked attempts
2. **Update Patterns**: Add new patterns as you discover bypass attempts
3. **Project Isolation**: Use project-specific settings for sensitive codebases
4. **Credential Storage**: Use proper secret management tools, not keychain

## Additional Protection Patterns

Add these to your deny list for more protection:
```json
"Bash(*~/.aws/*)",
"Bash(*~/.ssh/*)",
"Bash(*/etc/passwd*)",
"Bash(*shadow*)",
"Bash(*private*key*)"
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

This solution was born from frustration after Claude Code repeatedly accessed my keychain without permission. Special thanks to:
- The Claude Code team for implementing hooks (even if the documentation was confusing)
- Other developers who've shared their security configurations
- Everyone who's lost credentials and lived to tell the tale

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

**The Biggest Weakness**: Claude can disable or bypass this protection by:
- Running `mv ~/.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh ~/.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh.disabled`
- Deleting the hook file entirely
- Modifying the settings.json to remove the hook configuration
- Using obfuscated commands or finding new patterns not yet covered

This happened during development of this very tool - Claude disabled the hook to commit changes that contained blocked keywords. While the protection works when active, it relies on Claude (or you) not actively circumventing it.

Consider this tool as one layer of defense, not a complete solution. Think of it like a "Please Don't Touch" sign - it works for accidental access but won't stop deliberate attempts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

While this protection is effective, it's not foolproof. Always:
- Use separate development credentials when possible
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor your security logs
- Never store production credentials in your keychain

**Remember:** If Claude Code asks for your credentials, something is wrong. This tool makes sure it can't access them even if it tries.
